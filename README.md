# My_SAP_Logisim
My SAP Computer in Logisim

This is my implementation of SAP (Simple As Possible) 8-bit Computer. This is based on the breadboard computer series by 
YouTuber, Ben Eater. I've built a working breadboard version and have been waiting for quite a while to see how Ben plans
to implement arithmetic flags and conditional jumps. I've been inspired to move this off the breadboards. I've built a 
control board with the Clock, Run/Stop and Step controls and an 8 bit Program Counter board.

I didn't want to go too far until I have an idea how to implement the missing functions so I decided to learn Logisim to 
see if I can design it myself. I don't expect the actual hardware to be as easy as Logisim but at least I know I have a 
design that works.

I wrote some Powershell scripts to generate the ROM files. I couldn't get Logisim to read a file I created but I could copy 
and paste from my file to a file generated by Logisim. By using mnemonics that are unique to each opcode it was easy to write 
a simple assembler in Google Sheets. I tried to save it as an Excel file but the formulas didn't work and I didn't feel like 
debugging it.
